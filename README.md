### Hey! I'm Noah. I recently finished an intense 800 hour web-development course in which I went from having no knowledge of programming, to building the projects pinned below. These projects are rough, no doubt, but they show my learning and ability to collaborate over a period of 17 weeks. Monster Mash is the latest project I worked on, and will continue to work on in order to continue my learning.
